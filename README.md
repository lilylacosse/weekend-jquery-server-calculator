# JQuery Server-Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 12 Hours_

Task: Create a functioning calculator that implements all of the logic on the server-side of the application. D

Creating the basic calculator and transfering the data from the client to the server side was a worthy challenge. Things got really interesting and fun when I morphed my calculator from two input fields and the appropriate buttons to an interface that actually mimics the look and operating principles of a normal calculator. 

Desire components:
1. Create a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and select the type of mathematical operation. 
2. A submit button for calculating. 
3. A clear button for clearing the equation. 
4. Build out the server-side logic to handle Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 
5. Keep a historical record of all math operations and solutions on the server. 

## Usage

1. Basic Calculations! 
2. Ability to reference calculation history. 

## Built With

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
JQuery
